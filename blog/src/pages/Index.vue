          Currently, I'm part of an incredible team at Hacksplash and learning
          user interface design. In addition, I'm the co-lead of the Google

          personal website. Apart from that I also enjoy reading both
          non-fiction and fiction,watching crime dramas and anime, and evening
          walks.
